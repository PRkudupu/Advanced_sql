Normalization: 
Is the process of reducing duplicates in the table.
 
FIRST NORMAL FORM
 	Tables must not contain repeating groups of data in 1 column

 SECOND NORMAL FORM
	Tables must not contain redundancy (unnecessary repeating information)

•	After applying first normal form

 
Note  : when we update a movies duration we have to update every duplicate row.

•	After applying second normal form
     
•	We need to have the mapping table
