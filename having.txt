1) Use the GROUP BY clause to write a query that returns the country name and total salary paid to actors for each country.
2) Now use the HAVING clause to add a filter so that only countries with more than 1 actor are returned from our SQL query.
3) Lastly, letâ€™s add a condition to filter only actors with a supporting role. This condition will need to be run before the grouping of records happen
select country,sum(salary) from Actors
where role='supporting'
group by country
having count(*) >1;
