 RANK VARIANCE PER COIUNTRY
 
 Which countries have risen in the rankings based on the number of comments between Dec 2019 vs Jan 2020? 
 Hint : avoid gaps between ranks when ranking countries
        (It is saying that do not use rank as it would provide gaps while ranking)

 fb_comments_count
 	user_id               int
 	created_at            datetime
 	number_of_comments    int
 
 fb_active_users    
 	user_id   int
      name      varchar
      status    varchar
      country   varchar


IDENTIFY THE COLUMNS WHAT WE NEED
    country : 
    user_id : 
    number_of_comments : where we get the comments 
    created_at : between dec 2019 to Jan 2020

    Note: 
	    1)Every user in the table might not have commented
           fb_comments_count would be the subset of fb_active_users
           we can use left_join from fb_active_users table to fb_comments_count table
          2)Rankings : If we do not have comments then we are rising in ranking.
APPROACH
    1) JOIN the 2 tables on user_id (left join because not all users would have made comments)
    2) Filter out table for Dec 2019 and Jan 2020 (Create 2 sub queries)
    3) Exclude rows where country is empty
    4) Sum the number of comments per country
    5) Use FULL join to compare DEC 19 and JAN 20 comments
    6) Rank 2019 comment counts and 2020 comment
    7) Apply final filter to fetch only countries with raking decline (Jan rank < Dec rank)
